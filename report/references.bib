  abstract = {Introduction: Thyroid dysfunction can cause inspiratory and expiratory muscle weakness in patients with or without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Thyroid dysfunction in COPD results in increased frequency of exacerbation thus lead to poor quality of life. It may further increase cardiovascular disease risk thereby increasing mortality. Aims and Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and hence that the quality of life of COPD can be improved Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional \textendash{} prevalence study. The study was conducted over a period of 1 year from August 2015 to July 2016. The study group was consists of male and female COPD patients diagnosed with spirometry and severity was determined according to the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease classification criteria. The patients were enrolled in this study from medicine outpatient department (OPD), respiratory OPD and those admitted to indoor wards of Medicine Department. Patients were screened for thyroid dysfunction. Results: Out of 171 patients, thyroid dysfunction was present in 43 patients. All of them were hypothyroid. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction was 25\%. In Stage A it was 20.5\%, Stage B 25.7\%, Stage C 23.4\%, and in Stage D 30.4\%. Thyroid dysfunction was associated with more frequent exacerbation. Conclusion: Thyroid dysfunction is a common extrapulmonary manifestation in COPD patients. It is associated with frequent exacerbations which affect the quality of life in these patients. Early detection and proper management can improve the quality of life in these patients.},

Women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have less emphysema and more small airway disease on average than men, though these differences become less pronounced with more severe airflow limitation. While small studies of targeted metabolites have identified compounds differing by sex and COPD status, the sex-specific effect of COPD on systemic metabolism has yet to be interrogated. Significant sex differences were observed in 9 of the 11 modules identified in COPDGene. Sex-specific associations by COPD status and emphysema were observed in 3 modules for each phenotype. Sex stratified individual metabolite associations with COPD demonstrated male-specific associations in sphingomyelins and female-specific associations in acyl carnitines and phosphatidylethanolamines. There was high preservation of module assignments in SPIROMICS (SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study) and similar female-specific shift in acyl carnitines. Several COPD associated metabolites differed by sex. Acyl carnitines and sphingomyelins demonstrate sex-specific abundances and may represent important metabolic signatures of sex differences in COPD. Accurately characterizing the sex-specific molecular differences in COPD is vital for personalized diagnostics and therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Background: Small studies have recently suggested that there are specific plasma metabolic signatures in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but there have been no large comprehensive study of metabolomic signatures in COPD that also integrate genetic variants. Materials and Methods: Fresh frozen plasma from 957 non-Hispanic white subjects in COPDGene was used to quantify 995 metabolites with Metabolon's global metabolomics platform. Metabolite associations with five COPD phenotypes (chronic bronchitis, exacerbation frequency, percent emphysema, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume at one second [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC], and FEV1 percent predicted) were assessed. A metabolome-wide association study was performed to find genetic associations with metabolite levels. Significantly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms were tested for replication with independent metabolomic platforms and independent cohorts. COPD phenotype-driven modules were identified in network analysis integrated with genetic associations to assess gene-metabolite-phenotype interactions. Results: Of metabolites tested, 147 (14.8\%) were significantly associated with at least 1 COPD phenotype. Associations with airflow obstruction were enriched for diacylglycerols and branched chain amino acids. Genetic associations were observed with 109 (11\%) metabolites, 72 (66\%) of which replicated in an independent cohort. For 20 metabolites, more than 20\% of variance was explained by genetics. A sparse network of COPD phenotype-driven modules was identified, often containing metabolites missed in previous testing. Of the 26 COPD phenotype-driven modules, 6 contained metabolites with significant met-QTLs, although little module variance was explained by genetics. Conclusion: A dysregulation of systemic metabolism was predominantly found in COPD phenotypes characterized by airflow obstruction, where we identified robust heritable effects on individual metabolite abundances. However, network analysis, which increased the statistical power to detect associations missed previously in classic regression analyses, revealed that the genetic influence on COPD phenotype-driven metabolomic modules was modest when compared with clinical and environmental factors.},

Although COPD is a lung disease, it has systemic manifestations that are associated with a dysregulated metabolome in extrapulmonary compartments (e.g., blood and urine). In this scoping review of the COPD metabolomics literature, we identified 37 publications with a primary metabolomics investigation of COPD phenotypes in human subjects through Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. These studies consistently identified a dysregulation of the TCA cycle, carnitines, sphingolipids, and branched-chain amino acids. Many of the COPD metabolome pathways are confounded by age and sex. The effects of COPD in young versus old and male versus female need further focused investigations. There are also few studies of the metabolome's association with COPD progression, and it is unclear whether the markers of disease and disease severity are also important predictors of disease progression.},

There has been a growing interest in the potential use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AASs) in patients with COPD recently. However, whether AASs could improve their clinical outcomes remains unknown.MethodsIn order to explore the efficacy of AASs in patients with COPD, systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AASs for COPD published before March 17, 2022 was performed.ResultsData were extracted from 8 articles involving 520 participants. The median number of participants per study was 39.5 and the mean follow up was 14.2 weeks. As compared to the control group, AASs therapy could significantly improve body weight (weighted mean difference (WMD), 1.38 kg; 95\% CI, 0.79 to 1.97 kg), fat-free mass (WMD, 1.56 kg; 95\% CI, 0.94 to 2.18 kg) and peak workload (WMD, 6.89W; 95\% CI, 3.97 to 9.81W) of COPD patients, but no improvements in spirometry indicators and six-minute walking distances (WMD, 16.88 m; 95\%, -3.27 to 37.04 m). Based on the available research data, it is uncertain whether AASs treatment could improve the quality of life of COPD patients.ConclusionsLimited published evidence indicates that AASs therapy provides clinical benefits in patients with COPD. However, longer and larger studies are needed to better clarify the efficacy of AASs and draw final conclusions.},

Many endocrinological disorders, including thyroid gland diseases are related to systemic inflammation. Epidemiological studies suggest that patients with COPD are at higher risk of thyroid disorders. These associations are not well-studied and thyroid gland diseases are not included on the broadly acknowledged list of COPD comorbidities. They may seriously handicap quality of life of COPD patients. Unfortunately, the diagnosis may be difficult, as many signs are masked by the symptoms of the index disease. The comprehension of the correlation between thyroid gland disorders and COPD may contribute to better care of patients.

It is a compromise between the usual discriminant analysis and a discriminant analysis on the significant principal components of the predictor variables. This technique is specially suited to deal with a much larger number of predictors than observations and with multicollineality, two of the main problems encountered when analysing microarray expression data. We explore the performance of PLS-DA with published data from breast cancer (Perou et al. 2000). Several such analyses were carried out: (1) before vs after chemotherapy treatment, (2) estrogen receptor positive vs negative tumours, and (3) tumour classification. We found that the performance of PLS-DA was extremely satisfactory in all cases and that the discriminant cDNA clones often had a sound biological interpretation. We conclude that PLS-DA is a powerful yet simple tool for analysing microarray data.},

Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a `molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of `omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous `omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple `omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of `omics data available from the package.},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: COPD, a leading cause of mortality is currently assessed by spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV(1)). However FEV(1) does not correlate with patient mortality. ECLIPSE (Evaluation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to Longitudinally Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints) aims to identify biomarkers that correlate with clinically relevant COPD subtypes, and to assess how these may predict disease progression. New methods were developed and validated to evaluate small molecules as potential diagnostic tools in patients with COPD, COPD related cachexia and cancer related cachexia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: quantitative LC-MS/MS was developed to measure 34 amino acids and dipeptides for stratification of patient groups. Subsets of the ECLIPSE patients were used to assess biomarkers of lung obstruction; GOLD IV (n = 30) versus control (n = 30); emphysema (n = 38) versus airways disease (n = 21) and cachexia (n = 30) versus normal body mass index (n = 30). Serum from cachexic (n = 7) and non-cachexic (n = 5) pancreatic cancer patients were included as controls. Targeted LC-MS/MS distinguished GOLD IV patients from controls, patients with and without emphysema and patients with and without cachexia. Glutamine, aspartate and arginine were significantly increased (p {$<$} 0.05; FDR adjustment {$\alpha$} {$<$} 0.1) in cachexia, emphysema and GOLD IV patients and aminoadipate was decreased. Several amino acid concentrations were significantly altered in patients with COPD but not patients with pancreatic cancer (serine, sarcosine, tryptophan, BCAAs and 3-methylhistdine). Increased {$\gamma$}-aminobutyrate (GABA, p {$<$} 0.01) levels were specific to cachexia in patients with pancreatic cancer. {$\beta$}-aminoisobutyrate, 1-methylhistidine and asparagine (p {$<$} 0.05) were common across the patients with cachexia from both the COPD and pancreatic cancer cohorts. CONCLUSION: these results demonstrate that a metabolomic fingerprint has potential to stratify patients for the treatment of COPD and may provide a means of assessing response to therapy. GOLD IV patients were distinguished from smoker control subjects, patients with emphysema were distinguished from those without emphysema and COPD patients displaying cachexia were distinguished from those not displaying cachexia. General markers of cachexia were discovered reflecting both COPD- and pancreatic cancer-related cachexia (increased glutamine, aspartate, arginine, and asparagine and decreased aminoadipate, {$\beta$}-aminoisobutyrate and 1-methylhistidine). Metabolomic biomarkers, particularly altered levels of GABA, could be exploited as a way of monitoring treatment efficacy and tumour recurrence for patients with pancreatic cancer experiencing cachexia.},
