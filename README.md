This repository contains code for my final project in the course Biostatistics 611 (Introduction to Data Science) at UNC Chapel Hill. For this project, I intend to analyze data from the Plasma Metabolomic Signatures of COPD Study (doi: 10.21228/M8FQ2X). I hope to identify any associations between metabolites and BMI, smoker status, or sex and demonstrate these results with a compelling visualization. My secondary goals are to identify biologically-relevant clusters of metabolites and investigate the influence of different imputation strategies on these results.
